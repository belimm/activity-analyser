# activity-analyser
Practice via string processing and string matching with C programming language



<h2>Overview</h2>


Smart home systems have become very popular with the rapid deployment of the Internet of Things (IoT). These systems are used for different purposes, especially for reducing the cost of basic necessities. Smart home systems are also used in healthcare applications with the aim of monitoring the activities of people, especially elderly person, with the use of various sensors for anomaly detection.
In this assignment, you will need to develop a simple activity analyser for a studio apartment occupied by a single person. The plan of this studio apartment is provided in Figure 1. Yellow circles show binary motion sensors that become active (off > on) when the distance between the person and the sensor becomes very short.

Numbers in Figure 1 are simple sensors.
